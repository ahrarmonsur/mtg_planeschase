Magic the Gathering Planeschase Deck UI
This is a simple UI for playing Magic, the Gathering Planeschase format with a digital library of the cards. Currently the resolution is optimized for a 1366 x 768 screen, but general resolution support will be added in time. Currently only the code has beeen uploaded with a deck list, but I will include a link to download the image pack soon.
